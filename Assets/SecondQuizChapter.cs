    // (this will be shown when the player comes in to put the white butterfly in the flower and triggers the dialog that says the white flower can't come in)
    // to make sure that the player chooses his butterflies correctly (and not the white one first) we'll make sure to show one butterfly at a time, and display
    // the next one after it's been dragged into the flower.
